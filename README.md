#### Abstract
Our blackjack agent is designed to simulate the game from a player's perspective, optimizing decisions to maximize hand value while minimizing the risk of busting. Unlike traditional blackjack models, our agent does not compete against another player; instead, its performance is evaluated based on key metrics, including the average value of its hand, win-to-loss ratio against the dealer, probability of avoiding a bust, and the number of rounds won based on proximity to 21. The blackjack environment in which our agent operates is partially observable, as the player has no knowledge of the deck's composition. It is also stochastic, given that drawing a card introduces randomness, and sequential, since each decision affects future actions. Additionally, the environment is static, meaning the rules remain unchanged, discrete, as there are limited actions, and single-agent, focusing solely on the player's decision-making process. Our agent can perform three distinct actions: Hit (draw a card), Stand (end its turn) and Split (when dealt two identical cards). These actions are chosen based on information from its sensors, which include only the cards in the player's hand. By leveraging strategic decision-making, our model aims to improve blackjack play by balancing risk and reward while operating under uncertainty. Its success is measured through statistical performance metrics that assess its efficiency and effectiveness in achieving optimal outcomes.
